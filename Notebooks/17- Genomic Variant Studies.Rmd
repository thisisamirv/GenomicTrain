# Copy number variants (CNV)
**Log R Ratio (LRR):** The LRR is the normalized measure of total signal intensity and provides information relative to copy number or the number of alleles present in a biological sample at one SNP.
<br>
**B Allele Frequency (BAF):** BAF is derived from the ratio of between intensities of the allele probes, measuring the allele proportion or allele composition of the sample. In normal samples, the expected values are:

* 0 and 1 for homozygous genotypes (AA, BB)
* 0.5 for heterozygous genotypes (AB)
<br>

### CNV calling
Segmentation of LRR values along the chromosome together with BAF information are used to identify the regions with probable copy number alterations.
